Hello, this is my FinSave app project. Here I learned how to make my app during Advanced-Android cource in KBTU.<br />
In my project i used several tools and architectures. Not sure if i made it all in best way, but at least i tried XD.<br />
I used: 1)FireBase authentication<br />
        2)Room Database<br />
        3)Networks request using Retrofit2<br />
        4)RecyclerView with diffutil implementation<br />
        5)Lottie animation(not in best way, need to work on it)<br />
        6)MVVM architecture<br />
My current goals:<br />
        1)Implement FireBase BarCode reader in my project<br />
        2)Learn more about Coroutines and how to use it(now simply understand what is it)<br />
        3)Make better UI/UX<br />
        4)Make my project updates more often to track my improvement<br />
I thinks that's all, anyway, thank you for you attention  /* and hope for good marks on final XDD */(need to delete this part after) <br />
