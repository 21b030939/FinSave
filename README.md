Hello, this is my FinSave app project. Here I learned how to make my app during Advanced-Android cource in KBTU.<br />
In my project i used several tools and architectures. Not sure if i made it all in best way, but at least i tried XD.<br />
I used: 1)FireBase authentication
        2)Room Database
        3)Networks request using Retrofit2
        4)RecyclerView with diffutil implementation
        5)Lottie animation(not in best way, need to work on it)
        6)MVVM architecture
My current goals:
        1)Implement FireBase BarCode reader in my project
        2)Learn more about Coroutines and how to use it(now simply understand what is it)
        3)Make better UI/UX
        4)Make my project updates more often to track my improvement
I thinks that's all, anyway, thank you for you attention  /* and hope for good marks on final XDD */(need to delete this part after)
